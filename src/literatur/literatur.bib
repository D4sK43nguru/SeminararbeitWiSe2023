    abstract = {The subject of this thesis is the study of cryptographic hash functions. The importance of hash functions for protecting the authenticity of information is demonstrated. Applications include integrity protection, conventional message authentication and digital signatures. Theoretical results on cryptographic hash functions are reviewed. The information theoretic approach to authentication is described, and the practicality of schemes based on universal hash functions is studied. An overview is given of the complexity theoretic definitions and constructions. The main contribution of this thesis lies in the study of practical constructions for hash functions. A general model for hash functions is proposed and a taxonomy for attacks is presented. Then all schemes in the literature are divided into three classes: hash functions based on block ciphers, hash functions based on modular arithmetic and dedicated hash functions. An overview is given of existing attacks, new attacks are demonstrated, and new schemes are proposed. The study of basic building blocks of cryptographic hash functions leads to the study of the cryptographic properties of Boolean functions. New criteria are defined and functions satisfying new and existing criteria are studied.},

    Central to the secure operation of a public key infrastructure (PKI) is the ability to revoke certificates. While much of users' security rests on this process taking place quickly, in practice, revocation typically requires a human to decide to reissue a new certificate and revoke the old one. Thus, having a proper understanding of how often systems administrators reissue and revoke certificates is crucial to understanding the integrity of a PKI. Unfortunately, this is typically difficult to measure: while it is relatively easy to determine when a certificate is revoked, it is difficult to determine whether and when an administrator should have revoked.In this paper, we use a recent widespread security vulnerability as a natural experiment. Publicly announced in April 2014, the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug, potentially (and undetectably) revealed servers' private keys. Administrators of servers that were susceptible to Heartbleed should have revoked their certificates and reissued new ones, ideally as soon as the vulnerability was publicly announced.Using a set of all certificates advertised by the Alexa Top 1 Million domains over a period of six months, we explore the patterns of reissuing and revoking certificates in the wake of Heartbleed. We find that over 73\% of vulnerable certificates had yet to be reissued and over 87\% had yet to be revoked three weeks after Heartbleed was disclosed. Moreover, our results show a drastic decline in revocations on the weekends, even immediately following the Heartbleed announcement. These results are an important step in understanding the manual processes on which users rely for secure, authenticated communication.},

    abstract = {Increased user concern over security and privacy on the Internet has led to widespread adoption of HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS authenticates the communicating end points and provides confidentiality for the ensuing communication. However, as with any security solution, it does not come for free. HTTPS may introduce overhead in terms of infrastructure costs, communication latency, data usage, and energy consumption. Moreover, given the opaqueness of the encrypted communication, any in-network value added services requiring visibility into application layer content, such as caches and virus scanners, become ineffective.This paper attempts to shed some light on these costs. First, taking advantage of datasets collected from large ISPs, we examine the accelerating adoption of HTTPS over the last three years. Second, we quantify the direct and indirect costs of this evolution. Our results show that, indeed, security does not come for free. This work thus aims to stimulate discussion on technologies that can mitigate the costs of HTTPS while still protecting the user's privacy.},

This motivated the use of additional authentication mechanisms in so-called multi-factor authentication protocols. In this article, we define a detailed threat model for this kind of protocol: While in classical protocol analysis attackers control the communication network, we take into account that many communications are performed over TLS channels, that computers may be infected by different kinds of malware, that attackers could perform phishing, and that humans may omit some actions. We formalize this model in the applied pi calculus and perform an extensive analysis and comparison of several widely used protocols—variants of Google 2-step and FIDO’s U2F (Yubico’s Security Key token). The analysis is completely automated, generating systematically all combinations of threat scenarios for each of the protocols and using the PROVERIF tool for automated protocol analysis. To validate our model and attacks, we demonstrate their feasibility in practice, even though our experiments are run in a laboratory environment. Our analysis highlights weaknesses and strengths of the different protocols. It allows us to suggest several small modifications of the existing protocols that are easy to implement, as well as an extension of Google 2-step that improves security in several threat scenarios.},

In this paper, we report on the development and deployment of Crossbear, a tool to detect MitM attacks on SSL/TLS and localise their position in the network with a fair degree of confidence. MitM attacks are detected using a notary approach. For the localisation, we use a large number of traceroutes, conducted from so-called hunters from many positions on the Internet. Crossbear collects this data, orchestrates the hunting from a central point and provides the data for analysis. We outline the design of Crossbear and analyse the degree of effectivity that Crossbear achieves against attackers of different kinds and strengths. We also explain how analysis can make use of out-of-band sources like lookups of Autonomous Systems and geo-IP-mapping. Crossbear is already available, and 150 hunters have been deployed on the global PlanetLab testbed.},

    abstract = {Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterpriseowned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security posture.},

    ABSTRACT = {Recently, networks have shifted from traditional in-house servers to third-party-managed cloud platforms due to its cost-effectiveness and increased accessibility toward its management. However, the network remains reactive, with less accountability and oversight of its overall security. Several emerging technologies have restructured our approach to the security of cloud networks; one such approach is the zero-trust network architecture (ZTNA), where no entity is implicitly trusted in the network, regardless of its origin or scope of access. The network rewards trusted behaviour and proactively predicts threats based on its users&rsquo; behaviour. The zero-trust network architecture is still at a nascent stage, and there are many frameworks and models to follow. The primary focus of this survey is to compare the novel requirement-specific features used by state-of-the-art research models for zero-trust cloud networks. In this manner, the features are categorized across nine parameters into three main types: zero-trust-based cloud network models, frameworks and proofs-of-concept. ZTNA, when wholly realized, enables network administrators to tackle critical issues such as how to inhibit internal and external cyber threats, enhance the visibility of the network, automate the calculation of trust for network entities and orchestrate security for users. The paper further focuses on domain-specific issues plaguing modern cloud computing networks, which leverage choosing and implementing features necessary for future networks and incorporate intelligent security orchestration, automation and response. The paper also discusses challenges associated with cloud platforms and requirements for migrating to zero-trust architecture. Finally, possible future research directions are discussed, wherein new technologies can be incorporated into the ZTA to build robust trust-based enterprise networks deployed in the cloud.},

The concept of zero-trust is enjoying increasing attention in both research and practice due to its promise to fulfil complex new network security requirements. Despite zero-trust's advantages over traditional solutions, it has not yet succeeded in replacing existing approaches. Uncertainty remains regarding the concept's distinct benefits and drawbacks for organisations and individuals, which hinders a holistic understanding of zero-trust and wide-spread adoption. Research can make valuable contributions to the field by systematically providing new insights into zero-trust. To support researchers in this endeavour, we aim to consolidate the current state of the knowledge about zero-trust and to identify gaps in the literature. Thus, we conduct a multivocal literature review, analysing both academic and practice-oriented publications. We develop a research framework for zero-trust to structure the identified literature and to highlight future research avenues. Our results show that the academic literature has focused mainly on the architecture and performance improvements of zero-trust. In contrast, the practice-oriented literature has focused on organisational advantages of zero-trust and on potential migration strategies. However, economic analyses and user-related studies have been neglected by both academia and practice. Future research may rely on our findings to advance the field in meaningful ways.}
