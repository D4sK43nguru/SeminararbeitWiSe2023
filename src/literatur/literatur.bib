    abstract = {The subject of this thesis is the study of cryptographic hash functions. The importance of hash functions for protecting the authenticity of information is demonstrated. Applications include integrity protection, conventional message authentication and digital signatures. Theoretical results on cryptographic hash functions are reviewed. The information theoretic approach to authentication is described, and the practicality of schemes based on universal hash functions is studied. An overview is given of the complexity theoretic definitions and constructions. The main contribution of this thesis lies in the study of practical constructions for hash functions. A general model for hash functions is proposed and a taxonomy for attacks is presented. Then all schemes in the literature are divided into three classes: hash functions based on block ciphers, hash functions based on modular arithmetic and dedicated hash functions. An overview is given of existing attacks, new attacks are demonstrated, and new schemes are proposed. The study of basic building blocks of cryptographic hash functions leads to the study of the cryptographic properties of Boolean functions. New criteria are defined and functions satisfying new and existing criteria are studied.},

    abstract = {Central to the secure operation of a public key infrastructure (PKI) is the ability to revoke certificates. While much of users' security rests on this process taking place quickly, in practice, revocation typically requires a human to decide to reissue a new certificate and revoke the old one. Thus, having a proper understanding of how often systems administrators reissue and revoke certificates is crucial to understanding the integrity of a PKI. Unfortunately, this is typically difficult to measure: while it is relatively easy to determine when a certificate is revoked, it is difficult to determine whether and when an administrator should have revoked.In this paper, we use a recent widespread security vulnerability as a natural experiment. Publicly announced in April 2014, the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug, potentially (and undetectably) revealed servers' private keys. Administrators of servers that were susceptible to Heartbleed should have revoked their certificates and reissued new ones, ideally as soon as the vulnerability was publicly announced.Using a set of all certificates advertised by the Alexa Top 1 Million domains over a period of six months, we explore the patterns of reissuing and revoking certificates in the wake of Heartbleed. We find that over 73\% of vulnerable certificates had yet to be reissued and over 87\% had yet to be revoked three weeks after Heartbleed was disclosed. Moreover, our results show a drastic decline in revocations on the weekends, even immediately following the Heartbleed announcement. These results are an important step in understanding the manual processes on which users rely for secure, authenticated communication.},

    abstract = {Increased user concern over security and privacy on the Internet has led to widespread adoption of HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS authenticates the communicating end points and provides confidentiality for the ensuing communication. However, as with any security solution, it does not come for free. HTTPS may introduce overhead in terms of infrastructure costs, communication latency, data usage, and energy consumption. Moreover, given the opaqueness of the encrypted communication, any in-network value added services requiring visibility into application layer content, such as caches and virus scanners, become ineffective.This paper attempts to shed some light on these costs. First, taking advantage of datasets collected from large ISPs, we examine the accelerating adoption of HTTPS over the last three years. Second, we quantify the direct and indirect costs of this evolution. Our results show that, indeed, security does not come for free. This work thus aims to stimulate discussion on technologies that can mitigate the costs of HTTPS while still protecting the user's privacy.},

This motivated the use of additional authentication mechanisms in so-called multi-factor authentication protocols. In this article, we define a detailed threat model for this kind of protocol: While in classical protocol analysis attackers control the communication network, we take into account that many communications are performed over TLS channels, that computers may be infected by different kinds of malware, that attackers could perform phishing, and that humans may omit some actions. We formalize this model in the applied pi calculus and perform an extensive analysis and comparison of several widely used protocols--variants of Google 2-step and FIDO's U2F (Yubico's Security Key token). The analysis is completely automated, generating systematically all combinations of threat scenarios for each of the protocols and using the PROVERIF tool for automated protocol analysis. To validate our model and attacks, we demonstrate their feasibility in practice, even though our experiments are run in a laboratory environment. Our analysis highlights weaknesses and strengths of the different protocols. It allows us to suggest several small modifications of the existing protocols that are easy to implement, as well as an extension of Google 2-step that improves security in several threat scenarios.},

In this paper, we report on the development and deployment of Crossbear, a tool to detect MitM attacks on SSL/TLS and localise their position in the network with a fair degree of confidence. MitM attacks are detected using a notary approach. For the localisation, we use a large number of traceroutes, conducted from so-called hunters from many positions on the Internet. Crossbear collects this data, orchestrates the hunting from a central point and provides the data for analysis. We outline the design of Crossbear and analyse the degree of effectivity that Crossbear achieves against attackers of different kinds and strengths. We also explain how analysis can make use of out-of-band sources like lookups of Autonomous Systems and geo-IP-mapping. Crossbear is already available, and 150 hunters have been deployed on the global PlanetLab testbed.},

    abstract = {Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterpriseowned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise's overall information technology security posture.},

    abstract = {Recently, networks have shifted from traditional in-house servers to third-party-managed cloud platforms due to its cost-effectiveness and increased accessibility toward its management. However, the network remains reactive, with less accountability and oversight of its overall security. Several emerging technologies have restructured our approach to the security of cloud networks; one such approach is the zero-trust network architecture (ZTNA), where no entity is implicitly trusted in the network, regardless of its origin or scope of access. The network rewards trusted behaviour and proactively predicts threats based on its users\&rsquo; behaviour. The zero-trust network architecture is still at a nascent stage, and there are many frameworks and models to follow. The primary focus of this survey is to compare the novel requirement-specific features used by state-of-the-art research models for zero-trust cloud networks. In this manner, the features are categorized across nine parameters into three main types: zero-trust-based cloud network models, frameworks and proofs-of-concept. ZTNA, when wholly realized, enables network administrators to tackle critical issues such as how to inhibit internal and external cyber threats, enhance the visibility of the network, automate the calculation of trust for network entities and orchestrate security for users. The paper further focuses on domain-specific issues plaguing modern cloud computing networks, which leverage choosing and implementing features necessary for future networks and incorporate intelligent security orchestration, automation and response. The paper also discusses challenges associated with cloud platforms and requirements for migrating to zero-trust architecture. Finally, possible future research directions are discussed, wherein new technologies can be incorporated into the ZTA to build robust trust-based enterprise networks deployed in the cloud.},

The concept of zero-trust is enjoying increasing attention in both research and practice due to its promise to fulfil complex new network security requirements. Despite zero-trust's advantages over traditional solutions, it has not yet succeeded in replacing existing approaches. Uncertainty remains regarding the concept's distinct benefits and drawbacks for organisations and individuals, which hinders a holistic understanding of zero-trust and wide-spread adoption. Research can make valuable contributions to the field by systematically providing new insights into zero-trust. To support researchers in this endeavour, we aim to consolidate the current state of the knowledge about zero-trust and to identify gaps in the literature. Thus, we conduct a multivocal literature review, analysing both academic and practice-oriented publications. We develop a research framework for zero-trust to structure the identified literature and to highlight future research avenues. Our results show that the academic literature has focused mainly on the architecture and performance improvements of zero-trust. In contrast, the practice-oriented literature has focused on organisational advantages of zero-trust and on potential migration strategies. However, economic analyses and user-related studies have been neglected by both academia and practice. Future research may rely on our findings to advance the field in meaningful ways.},

    abstract = {Fuelled by recent technological advances, Machine Learning (ML) is being introduced to safety and security-critical applications like defence systems, financial systems, and autonomous machines. ML components can be used either for processing input data and/or for decision making. The response time and success rate demands are very high and this means that the deployed training algorithms often produce complex models that are not readable and verifiable by humans (like multi layer neural networks). Due to the complexity of these models, achieving complete testing coverage is in most cases not realistically possible. This raises security threats related to the ML components presenting unpredictable behavior due to malicious manipulation (backdoor attacks). This paper proposes a methodology based on established security principles like Zero-Trust and defence-in-depth to help prevent and mitigate the consequences of security threats including ones emerging from ML-based components. The methodology is demonstrated on a case study of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a sophisticated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) module.},

    abstract = {With the development of the Internet, the company network architecture is also undergoing profound changes, and the boundaries between the original internal network and external network are becoming increasingly blurred with the emergence of cloud services. More and more company businesses are deployed on the cloud server, which increases the risk of data exchange between the cloud server and the intranet. An implementation method of zero-trust architecture is proposed in this paper to apply to this scenario. The method can ensure safe and reliable data exchange when the external application server accesses the internal network, effectively protect network communication and business access while not affecting the original internal network protection measures, and make the company network safer and controllable.},

    abstract = {Designing complex, socio-technical, cyber-physical systems has become increasingly challenging in recent years. Interdependencies between engineering domains can lead to emergent behavior that is difficult to predict and manage. The recent shift toward model-based design has demonstrated significant advantages for minimizing these challenges (McDermott et al. 2020. Benchmarking the benefits and current maturity of model-based systems engineering across the enterprise. results of the model-based systems engineering (MBSE) maturity survey, part 1: Executive summary. Technical Report SERC-2020-SR-001, Systems Engineering Research Center.). Further, the early identification of safety and security design weaknesses in safety-critical systems leads to reduced redesign costs in later design phases (Yang and EI-Haik, 2003. Design for Six Sigma. McGraw-Hill, New York City; Clausing and Frey, 2005. Improving system reliability by failure-mode avoidance including four concept design strategies. Systems Engineering, 8(3), pp. 245–261.). As a result, this article contributes the Multidisciplinary Early Design Risk Assessment Framework (MEDRAF) methodology for early combined safety and security assessment based on interdisciplinary dependency models of a system. The focus is on factors contributing to the estimation of the probabilities of successful attacks on system components. The Zero Trust paradigm is applied in which all humans, hardware, and processes interacting with the system are considered to pose a security risk. A calculation of security-related probability estimates is presented which is dependent on the current global security environment. Subsequently, security and safety probability estimates are combined to present an overall safety-security risk calculation using hybrid safety-security trees. The risk values help designers assess the loss of specific key components and safety functions. The methodology is demonstrated with a case study of a spent fuel pool cooling system in a nuclear reactor. The results of the case study show that the risk of losing one key system component doubles when combining security and safety compared to only assessing safety events. This paper is based on a paper presented at the CIE 2020 conference (Papakonstantinou et al., 2020. Towards a zero trust hybrid security and safety risk analysis method. In International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference, American Society of Mechanical Engineers.).},

ZTA has been introduced as a fine-grained defense approach paradigm that shifts defenses from static, network-based perimeters to users, assets, and resources.1 It assumes that no entities outside and inside the protected system can be trusted and therefore requires articulated and high-coverage deployment of security controls, such as authentication and access control. In a way, ZTA is not new; the idea that securing a system requires pervasive, fine-grained, and continuous deployment of layered security controls is quite obvious. However, the current emphasis on ZTA is important as it pushes systematic approaches to cybersecurity.},

    abstract = {The traditional perimeter-based network protection model cannot adapt to the development of current technology. Zero trust is a new type of network security model, which is based on the concept of never trust and always verify. Whether the access subject is in the internal network or the external network, it needs to be authenticated to access resources. The zero trust model has received extensive attention in research and practice because it can meet the new network security requirements. However, the application of zero trust is still in its infancy, and enterprises, organizations, and individuals are not fully aware of the advantages and disadvantages of zero trust, which greatly hinders the application of zero trust. This paper introduces the existing zero trust architecture and analyzes the core technologies including identity authentication, access control, and trust assessment, which are mainly relied on in the zero trust architecture. The main solutions under each technology are compared and analyzed to summarize the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the current challenges and future research trends. Our goal is to provide support for the research and application of future zero trust architectures.},

The growth of ZTA has spiked over the years, but organizations are reluctant to invest in the security approach. Previous research studies cover ways to implement or migrate to ZTA, its significance, and challenges but provide limited information on available tools, prices, and the success rate of ZTA. Organizations lack information on the quantitative evaluations of ZTA benefits and drawbacks. An in-depth evaluation of ZTA to help security researchers better understand the costs and benefits of employing this new technology as a defence against cyber attacks is provided in this work. Results show that the implementation of ZTA causes a reduction of \$684K on average in risk impact over a span of four years for small to medium sized organizations and enterprise-level organizations.},

In this model, it is considered that threat to sensitive data may arise from inside and outside of the militarized zone. Outside locations include internet and cloud across a corporate network. Users from all locations may request access for the sensitive data. An access control proxy is introduced in this model to protect the sensitive data by controlling the access by analyzing access request, user type, device type, application type and data type. Accordingly new policies are implemented in ZTM to protect sensitive data. This model is found very effective in enhancing the security of sensitive data from unauthorized access and manipulation.},
